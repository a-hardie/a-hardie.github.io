				<p><i>Christmas with Alex and Friends</i> began as a simple idea to collaborate with my friends on a recording project.  I wanted to be able to include friends who lived all over the globe, so I recorded my parts and sent them to others to record their parts.  There are really no rules to how these songs get made, I just tell people to do whatever works.</p>
				<p>The resulting songs turn out to be very eclectic and fun. I hope you enjoy!</p>
